# Torqlang

## A fantastically simple approach to concurrent programming.

### Why?

Concurrent programming is notoriously hard. Mainstream programming languages require explicit control structures, resulting in unnatural, complex and tangled programs.

### How?

Torqlang solves this problem with a patent-pending programming model, named Actorflow, that fuses message-passing concurrency with declarative dataflow, giving us a naturally sequential style that is impossible to obtain in mainstream languages.
